## Documentation of Project

I have created this project basically using html,css and jquery for frontend and php Laravel for the
backend process. I have used the amezia template for the backend and also some packages like yajra
datatable, sweetalert, etc.

## http://127.0.0.1:8000/user
In this route, we can view all the user. I have used yajra datatable through ajax and also integrated
pagination while viewing the list. The filter is also done through on the datatable through ajax as a result
the user list will be shown without page reload.
